  This is by far my favorite building in Dubai. It symbolised the start of it
  all. The late his highness Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum. It was built in
  1978 and was the first high rise building in Dubai. It is also featured on the
  100 Dirham note the currency of the United Arab Emirates. The picture that is
  seared in my head is of the same setting but roll back 30 years. The road was
  2 lanes, no highway to be seen, no tunnels, no high rise buildings cluttering
  the background, just this magnificent building. It was featured in Dubai News
  on the old school Dubai TV.
