A day at the beach. July 30 2016

Living in the UAE, you tend to shy away from the sun when it becomes hot. The summers can be unbearable. The humidity will remove the fresh feeling you get post shower in an instant. Everyone tends to keep outdoor walking to a minimum. On the other hand, the autumn and winter are blissful. I know you chuckle at the idea that we have 4 seasons. It is true our weather has two seasons, summer and hell. Jokes aside, from October until Late April the weather is simply amazing. It can get a bit cold considering the population has to wither temperatures of high forties or even low fifties.

We are lucky to have beautiful beaches spanning all seven emirates. I've been lugging around my trust Leica MP and snapping some shots of such serene locales using the fine grain Kodak Ektar 100 film, scanned using a Epson V850 scanner.
