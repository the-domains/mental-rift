# Self explanatory

It still confuses me that people still smoke. The body of research is piling sky high and we get exposed to so many carcinogens as is. It is getting better. Society is expelling smokers outside be it in hot or cold climates. Seeing the patients who battle lung cancer and its effect on their lives and loved ones is always a grim experience.
