  I honestly cant wait for this game to come out. It has already gone gold and
  is enroute for a second week of August release. The idea of an unlimited world
  to explore in a space ship or on foot. Procedural generated events. Itâ€™s going
  to be crazy! Now the tough choice is to go for the convenience of console
  gaming or the power house PC gaming. The choices are tough!
