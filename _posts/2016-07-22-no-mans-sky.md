I honestly cant wait for this game to come out. It has already gone gold and is enroute for a second week of August release. The idea of an unlimited world to explore in a space ship or on foot. Procedural generated events. It's going to be crazy! Now the tough choice is to go for the convenience of console gaming or the power house PC gaming. The choices are tough!
